# Emoji Search (react.js)

# • Link: https://hani-alhamad-react-emoji-search.netlify.app/

• The API i used: https://emoji-api.com/   
• Features:
- Indicates which category you're at.   
- Clicking on any category icon scrolls down to it.   
- Search box (uses api).   

• Used Reactjs and CSS to create it.   
• React Hooks that i used: useContext, useState, useEffect, useCallback.   
• Used React Icons as well.   

- Many emojis don't show up in Chromium based browser (Chrome, Opera, Edge) and shows as a hollow square instead, also the API shows some wrong/duplicate results when i search through it sometimes, and I noticed that all emojis shows perfectly in Mozila Firefox browser.
